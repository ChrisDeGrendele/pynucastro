# Fortran: C12-burning

The URCA-boxlib example creates a reaction network which implements
simple C12-burning. It is intended to generate a network for
BoxLib/Microphysics for use in MAESTRO or CASTRO.

To use, generate the reaction network using c.py (pyreaclib directory
must be in your PYTHONPATH):

```
$ python c.py
```
