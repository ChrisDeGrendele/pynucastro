# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed from anyone.  *Any contributions that have
the potential to change answers should be done via pull requests.* A
pull request should be generated from your fork of pynucastro and target
the `master` branch.

You should run the unit tests on your changes, if possible, before
issuing the PR.  If there are a number of small commits making up the
PR, we may wish to squash commits upon merge to have a clean history.
*Please ensure that your PR title and first post are descriptive,
since these will be used for a squashed commit message.*
