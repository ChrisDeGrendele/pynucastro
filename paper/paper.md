# Summary

pynucastro addresses two needs in the field of nuclear astrophysics:
interactive exploration of nuclear reaction rates or networks and
automated code generation for integrating systems of differential
equations representing reaction networks. pynucastro accomplishes this
by interfacing with nuclear reaction rate parameterizations published
by the JINA Reaclib project [@Reaclib.2010].
