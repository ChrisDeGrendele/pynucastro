pynucastro
==============

pynucastro is a set of python interfaces to nuclear reaction rate
databases (including the JINA reaclib nuclear reaction rate database).
It is meant for both interactive exploration of rates (through Jupyter
notebooks) and to create reaction networks for use in simulation
codes.
